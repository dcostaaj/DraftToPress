          <p>On the 9th of November,1966, Paul McCartney was killed in a car crash. He was then replaced by a lookalike,
            often referred to a billy shears.
          </p>
          <p>This is all speculation; Paul McCartney himself recently went on tour. People saw him with their own eyes.
            It was clearly him. Not some body double. But the theory still stands.</p>
          <p>Alledgedly, Paul McCartney was killed in a car crash on his way home from a recording session. Wracked with
            guilt of losing their bandmate and unsure of what to say to the media, the Beatles hosted a lookalike
            competition for a body double to replace McCartney. </p>
          <p>Over the years fans of this theory had been obsessed with finding 'proof' of the death of Paul McCartney.
            McCartney himself has addressed the media claiming the theory to be untrue, and that he is perfectly fine.
            Even McCartney himself said ‘I am alive and well and unconcerned about the rumours of my death’ But this
            hasn’t stopped fans from theorising otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest and most famous pieces of 'evidence' lays on the cover of their eleventh studio album Let
            It Be.</p>
          <div class="image"> <img class="article" src="img/articleassets/tumblr_ncc87uWxxG1t8mdxmo3_400.webp">
          </div>
          <p>On the cover of this album the band is crossing the road. Together they all walk facing the right, all
            walking in sync. Except for Paul McCartney. He walks out of step to the rest of them. This cover is also
            said to not just show the Beatles walking but also has a deeper meaning. the fact he has his shoes off
            brings further to the ground, symbolizing that he is closer to the ground, that he is six feet under.
            through order of the band walking. John Lennon is walking first as the priest, followed by Ringo Star as the
            mourner, Paul McCartney as the deceased with his shoes off and finally George Harrison, bringing up the
            rearas the grave digger.
              </p>
          <div class="image"> <img class="article" src="img/articleassets/tumblr_ncc87uWxxG1t8mdxmo3_400.webp">
          </div>
          <p>Another piece of evidence is the hand over Paul's head on the Sgt pepper's Lonely Hearts club band cover.
          </p>
          <p>A hand’s palm out above someone's head can signal towards death. The movement symbolizes a priest blessing
            a corpse. </p>
          <p>Next to where the current Beatles stand, wax sculptures of the past Beatles stand together, looking down at
            the flowers on the floor. Ringo's head is bowed, and Paul stands next to him, both with sad faces and Paul
            seems to be comforting him. People say that this is because Ringo and Paul had a falling out the night of
            Pauls alleged death and Ringo is wracked with guilt, he can never take those words back and feels horrible.</p>
          <p>Overall, I don’t believe in these theories. Paul has said to media and press that he is in fact not dead.
            Yet fans still think others wise. This theory has sparked may long conversations and debates in the car with
            my dad. In the end, none of us know what happened that night. All we know is that Paul McCarney is either
            alive, or there is someone named Billy Shears posing as him. </p>
