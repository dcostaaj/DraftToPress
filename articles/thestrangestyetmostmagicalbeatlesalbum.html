        <p><em>I've never taken drugs before, but if I did, this album is what I imagine it would feel like.</em></p>
        <p><em>Magical Mystery Tour</em> is an album written by the Beatles, published on the 27th of November in 1967.
        </p>
        <p>This album was written when the Beatles started experimenting with LSD, and a lot of the songs are based off
          things they saw while on it, such as the song <em>I Am The Walrus</em>, I would sing you some of the lyrics but
          honestly, you'll just have listen for yourself. </p>
        <p>As well as the album, the Beatles also released a movie called <em>The Magical Mystery Tour</em> and just like the
          album, the movie is just as confusing and makes no sense. Both the album and the movie feel like a very
          dizzying ride. In 1967 the world had changed, Australia voted yes in a referendum to change to constitution.
          The outer space treaty was signed. Aretha franklin recorded the song respect. 1967 was quite the year. With
          the changes in the music industry and the changes in the world, the Beatles knew that they had to step up
          their music making game.</p>
        <p>The opening song to the album is called <em>Magical Mystery Tour</em>, this song welcomes people to the album. ‘Roll
          up roll up for the magical mystery tour step right this way’, this line is spoken before the lyrics come in.
          It feels like the band is introducing you to their newest album. One of the Beatles most famous songs comes
          from this album. ‘All you need is love" it's famous because of the message that it sends ‘all you need is
          love’</p>
        <p>The album is a strange but magical mix of songs that unlike many other Beatles albums, are not related and
          don't really tell a story. These songs seem to be telling individual stories about how the band was feeling
          and what was going on in their minds.</p>
        <p>Quite frankly this album is a mess. It's a mess of different instruments, sounds and overall is a different
          style to what the Beatles had been writing. But many praised the writing of the songs, and the changing of the
          style matched the change of the times.</p>
        <p>The album is quite the experience but the song <em>Strawberry Field Forever</em>, is my favourite. Strawberry fields
          is a salvation army children's home in the band’s hometown of Liverpool England. The song itself is about
          going down to strawberry fields and being free there. The chorus lyrics are ‘let me take you down cause I'm
          going to. Strawberry fields, nothing is real. Nothing to get hung about. Strawberry fields forever’. At the
          end of the song there is a mix of sounds and the band singing. I love the song because of the feeling of being
          free somewhere far away from here.
        </p>
        <p>This album was released during the '<a href=paulmccartney.html>Paul is dead conspiracy</a>, a period when
          people thought Paul Macartney was dead and the band was covering it up. This is because at the end of the song
          John Lennon says, "cranberry sauce", but people misheard it as "I buried Paul" </p>
        <p>The Beatles truly know what they're doing. Yes, the album is a large mess, but the songs are beautiful and
          creative, they have new sounds and a new feeling to them. Whenever I listen to this album, I feel as high as
          the Beatles did when creating it.
        </p>
