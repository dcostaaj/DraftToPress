        <p>On New Year’s Eve, when I was eight years old, I found myself sitting in a family friend’s house in Sydney.
          My mum and dad had gone out to a New Year’s party, leaving me with their friends’ children and a babysitter
          for the night. There were 6 kids in total as I have two younger siblings, and our family friends also had
          three kids. We sat on the couch arguing for what felt like hours, we couldn’t decide on a movie to watch.
          Until someone suggested 'The Sound of Music' somehow, we all decided to give it ago with the persuading from
          our babysitter. Within minutes all 7 of us were stuck to the TV watching the breathtaking scenery and
          listening to the entrancing songs. As the movie went on, I became completely absorbed in the story of Maria
          and the von Trapp family. Even as a child, I was struck by how full of warmth and optimism Maria was,
          transforming a strict household through kindness and music. The songs — Do-Re-Mi and My Favorite Things stayed
          in my head long after the credits rolled, and I remember us all trying to sing them the next morning, laughing
          when we forgot the words. As the story grew more serious, with the family fleeing from the Nazis, I began to
          understand that the film wasn’t just about music and happiness — it was also about courage and hope in dark
          times.</p>

        <p>Looking back now, I realise The Sound of Music was my first experience of how powerful storytelling can be.
          It wasn’t just a movie to entertain children; it was a film that showed how love, music, and resilience can
          overcome fear. The Sound of Music is one of those timeless movies that continues to be loved by people of all
          generations. Its music gives the film a joyful and uplifting tone, yet it also carries deep emotional meaning,
          especially when the family is forced to flee from the Nazis. This balance between happiness and hardship shows
          the film’s depth and reminds audiences why it remains such an important and powerful story. That night, it
          became more than just a New Year’s memory but was the beginning to understanding how storytelling can provide
          comfort, inspire, and change your perspective on the world.   </p>
