        <p>After watching the Sound of Music, it brought me back to my childhood and reminded me of my own connections
          to the movie, from having a nanny growing up. My family had recently moved to Belgium from Germany when I was
          around 1 years old, my parents both had big jobs and had the support from their company to get an Au pair.
          This is when they found Danna.</p>
          <p> Danna soon moved in with us, and saw us grow up through the many years we lived
          in Belgium. She helped us through my sister being born, myself starting at Le Creche (my daycare). She helped
          me through my first day without my dummy, dislocating my elbow and adjusting to the cold weather. She became
          like a second mother to my sister and I and a shoulder to lean on for my parents. My sister, Dana and I would
          spend a lot of time together, walking in the forest behind my house. Looking back upon those memories I can
          see how similar they are to the adventures that Maria von Trapp and the kids would go on together.   </p>
        <p>Even though I haven't been able to seen her in many years, she still remains as such an important figure in
          my life. Watching the sound of music reminded me how lucky I was to have grown up with someone like her,
          someone who made a foreign place feel like home. Like Maria, Danna showed me what love, kindness and family
          truly mean. </p>
