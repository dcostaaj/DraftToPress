        <p>Unlike the Von Trapps, music has always felt like a large part of my life. As young as I can remember, we had
          glorious sing-alongs at family Christmases and other gatherings, my aunty or grandmother, or one of my
          parents, sitting at the piano with everyone else surrounding. My cousins and I shaking and banging and
          striking a variety of percussive instruments from a bag that my mum made sure never to forget. The sound of
          music was very much alive in our households. </p>
        <p>I started learning piano very soon after that, and that is when I realised that music also requires work.
          Practice, and potentially lots of that. Scales, exercises, finger techniques: music became a chore. </p>
        <p>At the age of 5, I gave up on my musical journey.</p>
        <p>And then, at the age of 6, I rediscovered what music is actually about: playing with others. I joined my
          school’s band, and quickly rekindled my love and joys for the art of playing, specifically on the
          glockenspiel. Although I still had to practice (although, mostly during our rehearsals themselves), I actually
          found it fun.</p>
        <p>Very soon after that, I restarted piano lessons, this time with the person who was running the band. I
          enjoyed them a lot more after that, and started enjoying other things like improvising in our school’s rock
          band, which led me down the path of composition.</p>
        <p>One day, after watching a movie scored by Alexandre Desplat, I loved the music so much I tried composing a
          piece inspired by that. It was far from perfect, it was awful in fact. It sounded atrocious but at the time I
          enjoyed it. I decided to post it on a YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>The next day, at school, I woke up to the small number of maybe 60 views, and it slowly increased to maybe a
          hundred eventually. It wasn’t the most, but it gave me the inspiration to continue.</p>
        <p>I slowly composed more and more, trying different tools like FL Studio and Vital Synth, and focussing on
          different types of music. And that is basically where I am now, continuing to make a new piece every once in a
          while, continuing to improve, as well as playing double bass in the school Jazz Band, Orchestra and singing in
          the school’s choir.</p>
