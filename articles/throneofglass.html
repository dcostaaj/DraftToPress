        <p>Oh. My. God. This series has left me totally empty and unable to pick up another book. To be honest after I
          read the <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em> (ACOTAR) series also by Sarah j Mass, I thought there was no way it could be topped. But oh, I was so
          very wrong. This series was impossible to put down, I feel as though I know these characters as well as I know
          the back of my own hand. Well, I guess that should be expected after reading the eight hefty books that the
          series comprises of. Kingdom of ash, the last book in the series, is 992 pages long, and it wasn’t nearly long
          enough to satisfy me. The way the characters develop, and you seriously could NEVER predict the sequence of
          events that take place within the series, makes it so captivating that I couldn’t move from my spot perched on
          the couch until I had consumed every page and detail that I could. I found myself cancelling plans, faking
          sick, just so I could stay home and indulge myself in the extraordinary magical world of the throne of glass
          series.</p>
        <p> As I'm sure any fan of Sarah j Mass is aware, her three main series; Throne of glass, Cresent City, and A
          court of thorns and roses, are due to collide in the ACOTAR 6 book. I cannot contain my excitement to see my
          favourite characters from different universes to collide, I can't wait to see who gets along and the dynamic
          between the characters. We saw a small snippet in Kingdom of ash and a court of frost and starlight; we see a
          small interaction between the universe and that had me running around the house like a hyper dog.</p>
        <p>Overall, Sarah j Mass creates such unique and complicated characters that you instantly fall in love with.
          She can make you go from hating a character and waiting for their demise, to wishing they were real so that
          you could give them a warm embrace. </p>
        <p>The last ACOTAR book was released in 2021, and Sarah has just posted on her Instagram that the ACOTAR 6 draft
          is FINALLY completed. Now we all just must wait brimming with anticipation for the release of the book we have
          all been waiting for. </p>
