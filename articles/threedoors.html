        <p>Some stories fade as you grow older, but others stay with you, echoing in your imagination long after you’ve
          closed the final page. For me, that story was Emily Rodda’s The Three Doors. I first read The Three Doors by
          Emily Rodda when I was about 10 or 11 years old, and even though I’ve read plenty of books since, this one has
          stayed with me. At that age, I was just starting to explore fantasy properly, and The Three Doors felt like a
          gateway into bigger, more complex worlds of imagination. It wasn’t just entertaining, it made me think about
          the choices people make and how one decision can change everything.</p>
        <p>The story follows Rye, a boy living on the isolated island of Weld, where everyone lives in fear of the
          ferocious Skimmers that attack at night. When his two older brothers vanish after volunteering to go on a
          dangerous mission beyond the Wall, Rye sets out to find them. But before he can leave, he must choose one of
          three magical doors, each leading to a different world, each filled with danger, mystery, and hidden truths.
          What struck me as a kid was how daring that choice felt: the idea that once you stepped through a door, you
          couldn’t turn back. I remember asking myself, which door would I have chosen?</p>
        <p>Each door revealed something new and unexpected, worlds that felt like medieval kingdoms with dragons and
          castles, futuristic cities filled with strange technology, and others that echoed our own time more closely.
          It felt almost like travelling through history and the future at the same time, but with real risks and
          consequences. I was fascinated by how Rodda managed to connect these very different settings into one story
          that made sense.</p>
        <p>Looking back now, I realise that what made the book so memorable for me wasn’t just the fantasy elements, but
          the themes underneath them. Rye’s journey is really about courage, responsibility, and growing up. He isn’t
          the strongest or bravest character at the start, but through his choices, he proves himself. That idea, that
          ordinary people can find bravery when it’s needed most, meant a lot to me when I was younger, and it still
          resonates now.</p>
        <p>Of course, the book is aimed at younger readers, so as an older reader some parts might feel predictable or
          straightforward. But at the same time, there’s a timeless quality to the way Rodda tells her stories. She
          writes with such clarity that the worlds feel real, and her mix of mystery, fantasy, and adventure is easy to
          get swept up in. For me, The Three Doors wasn’t just another book I read and forgot, it became one of those
          stories that made me really enjoy quests and fantasy worlds in me.</p>
        <p>I’d recommend this book especially for readers aged 10+ who enjoy fantasy adventures, riddles, and stories
          about choices. It’s perfect for anyone who liked Deltora Quest or who enjoys time-bending adventures where
          every decision matters. Older readers might still find it fun as a nostalgic, fast-paced read.</p>
        <p>In the end, The Three Doors is more than just a fantasy quest. It’s about what it means to step into the
          unknown, take risks, and grow through the challenges you face. Reading it at 10 or 11, it didn’t just
          entertain me, it opened doors in my imagination that I’ve kept with me ever since.</p>
