          <p>As Christmas approached, our home was filled with festive cheer. Lights on the windows, and the scent of
            gingerbread and pine from the Christmas tree filled the air. But this year there was a new arrival.</p>
          <p>We all him but he got scarred staying close to my grandpa who had been fostering him for a little while. he
            was still very anxious about the hustle and bustle of the holiday season. Whenever someone he liked left the
            room to fetch something or to prepare cookies, he would cry and cry especially if it was my grandpa, his
            heart racing at the thought of being left alone. </p>
          <p>On Christmas Eve, the family gathered around the tree, excitedly wrapping presents and sharing stories. The
            new guest sat on the blankets on the couch, observed it all, feeling the warmth of their laughter and love
            but still was weary. Rosie our older black dog, lay nearby, watching him with a knowing look.</p>
          <p>Opening presents we had one for our new arrival, we handed him a special present. His eyes lit up, he was
            just having some fun when Rosie sprinted over stealing the gift liking it more than him apparently.</p>
          <p>However, as everyone cheered for him, the excitement got the better of him. He began to jump around
            joyfully, but during his excitement, he felt that familiar rush of nausea. Before anyone could react, he
            threw up. “Oh no!”</p>
          <p>As the days go by my grandpa leaves, but our new arrival at Christmas stays he cries and cries for him and
            we try to comfort him, day in day out. As the days went by, our new friend started to feel more at home. His
            nervousness faded a little, and he began to explore the house with a wagging tail. The weeks go by, and he
            starts warming up to us showing us affection and is getting attached again. Now throwing up when we came
            home and crying every time someone left the room, “yay”, but nonetheless we loved him.</p>
          <p>Playing with his toys, Rosie and cuddling on the couch became his favourite things to do. He was learning
            that he could trust us and that love could help him feel safe. Each day, he showed us a little more of his
            true self, and we knew he was beginning to find his place in our home.</p>
          <p>Hamish, the small, scared, and funny orange dog was now our newest family member.</p>
