        <p><em>‘I never see her without a book in her hands’
            my teachers would always tell me this
            my parents had laughed.</em> </p>

        <p>Growing up, reading was not my thing. I didn’t understand it and fell behind the class quickly. </p>
        <p>When I was in year 1, I was taken to an optometrist and given glasses. I sat close to the whiteboard so I
          could read what the teacher was writing, I wore my glasses constantly, but nothing helped, i was still
          struggling with reading. I moved to Wesley after I was diagnosed with dyslexia, things finally started to make
          sense. I joined a group with other people with reading difficulties, and all was well. </p>
        <p>My parents took me to a program called Lindamood-bell; There I learnt skills to aid me with reading, and
          soon, I fell in love with books. </p>
        <p>In Year 3 I read Percy Jackson and the lighting thief. At the time I didn’t want to admit it, but Rick
          Riordan –the author- had made me fall in love with books. I did not read nearly as much as I do now, but it
          started this spark for reading deep inside me. I started reading to myself instead of having someone read for
          me, and this was a big step for me. </p>
        <p>In year 4 we noticed that I was struggling with multiplication. Really struggling with multiplication. So, I
          went to the doctor again and got a diagnosis for dyscalculia. A learning disability, those who are affected
          with it struggled with maths. They took me to Linda mood-bell again to work on my multiplication. I felt like
          I was getting better. I finished the year knowing significantly more than I had at the start. I felt more
          prepared to go into year 5.
        </p>
        <p>In year 5 we noticed that I struggled with Chinese. Then I got diagnose with dysgraphia, a learning
          disability that affects how I see shapes. Covid hit. With no teachers around to check on me and guide me I
          found working extremely hard. I started working in an individual needs group inside Wesley and we met together
          to work on class work and get extra help.</p>
        <p>Years 7-8 were very hard. I started science and started really struggling and falling behind. The individual
          need classes that I took part in worked on my writing and numeracy skills, and that didn’t really extend or
          apply to science, I was on my own.
          My grades weren't reflecting how hard I was trying. Because I was trying as hard as I could, yet my grades
          appeared seemed to be falling. </p>
        <p>Year 9-10, things finally changed. I started getting more help when I needed it. I started asking for help.
          And things are much better now. I know that my skills in maths and certain areas of reading are behind my
          peers. But I read all the time now.
          people never see me without a book in my hands </p>
